# ISP_IP-URL-Scanner-
The final product of our ISP project is a web application that can be used to minimize the time consumption of L1 SOC analysts when completing the initial analysis in determining if a IP address or a URL is malicious.

Problem Identified: 
Determining if a certain file, IP address or a URL is malicious or not is the initial analysis of a L1 SOC analyst. This is a time consuming activity, usually taking 20-30 minutes if done manually by a person. To determine the safety level of an IP, URL or a file, SOC Analysts use many open source tools. In an instance of critical situation, a quick analysis is needed. For this, the efficiency of determining the safety level of IP/URL/File is crucial since it's the most time consuming part of the analysis.

Solution:
A product that minimize the initial analysis time of determining whether a file/IP/URL is malicious or not.

Web Application:
A tool with intergrated APIs of open source tools to give the final output required by the L1 SOC Analyst.
